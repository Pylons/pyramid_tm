Next release
============

- A new header ``X-Tm`` is now honored by the ``default_commit_veto`` commit
veto hook. If this header exists in the headerlist, its value must be a
string. If its value is ``commit``, the transaction will be committed
regardless of the status code or the value of ``X-Tm-Abort``. If the value
of the ``X-Tm`` header is ``abort`` (or any other string value except
``commit``), the transaction will be aborted, regardless of the status code
or the value of ``X-Tm-Abort``.
